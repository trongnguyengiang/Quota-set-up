# Quota-set-up

In our daily work at Analytix Intelligence, quota set-up is an important step but it takes quite a long time as our team members have to do everything manually from scratch. This code helps to automate this process. With only a few information, the formula could be set-up properly in a short time with minimun human error.

In this example, "Statewide CA TX OH FL WI n100.xlsx" is the input file and "With new codesheet.xlsx" is the output file.
